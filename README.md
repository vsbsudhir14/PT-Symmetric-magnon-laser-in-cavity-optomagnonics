PT Symmetric Magnon Laser in Cavity Optomagnonics

Presentation on November 29, 2022

Derived the governing equations for a PT symmetric magnon laser in cavity optomagnonics. Simulated plots of mode splitting, phase space diagram, magnon gain, stimulated emission for a PT symmetric magnon laser. Currently working on reproduced a paper on the same title and currently working on realizing continuous frequency regulation in a laser field.
